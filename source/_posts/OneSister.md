## One Sister have I in our house

One Sister have I in our house,

And one, a hedge away.

There's only one recorded,

But both belong to me.

One came the road that I came -

And wore my last year's gown –

The other, as a bird her nest,

Builded our hearts among.

She did not sing as we did –

It was a different tune –

Herself to her a music

As Bumble bee of June.

Today is far from Childhood –

But up and down the hills

I held her hand the tighter –

Which shortened all the miles –

And still her hum

The years among,

Deceives the Butterfly;

Still in her Eye

The Violets lie

Mouldered this many May.

I spilt the dew –

But took the morn – I chose this single star

From out the wide night's numbers –

Sue – forevermore!
